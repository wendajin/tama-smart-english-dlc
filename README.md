homebrew translations of tamagotchi smart cards

Hello,
i found out there are no english translations freely avaible.
So i started to translate the tamasma cards.

I will publish patch files here, to use them go to the page:
https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/  (not my page)
or similiar and put the original rom dump there and my specific patch.

If you find any issues write a comment.

Hope you like it :)

....
English nor japanese is my first language so please dont expect perfect DLC.
I mainly did it for me and my wife.
